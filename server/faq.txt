                    SENTINEL SUPPLY CHAIN PLATFORM - FAQ & GUIDES
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1: HOW TO LOGIN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How do I login to the Sentinel platform?
A: Follow these steps to login:
   1. Make sure you have MetaMask browser extension installed
   2. Go to the Sentinel homepage and click "Connect Wallet"
   3. MetaMask will pop up - approve the connection request
   4. The system will check if your wallet is registered
   5. If registered, you'll be asked to sign a verification message
   6. Sign the message in MetaMask (this proves you own the wallet)
   7. You'll be redirected to your role-specific dashboard

Q: What is wallet-based authentication?
A: Sentinel uses Web3 authentication instead of passwords. Your MetaMask wallet 
   serves as your identity. You prove ownership by signing a message with your 
   private key. This is more secure than traditional passwords because:
   - No password to steal or forget
   - Cryptographic proof of identity
   - Works across all blockchain applications

Q: Why does MetaMask ask me to sign a message?
A: Signing the message proves you own the wallet address. The message contains 
   a unique nonce (one-time code) that prevents replay attacks. You're not 
   sending any transaction or spending any gas - it's just a signature.

A: As a Supplier, follow these steps:
   1. Go to your Supplier Dashboard
   2. Click "Create Shipment" or the "+" button
   3. Fill in the shipment details:
      - Product Name: What you're shipping
      - Quantity: Number of units
      - Description: Additional details about the product
      - Origin Location: Where the shipment starts
      - Destination: Final delivery address
      - Select Transporter: Choose from approved transporters
      - Select Warehouse: Choose intermediate storage (optional)
      - Select Retailer: Final recipient
   4. Review all details carefully
   5. Click "Create Shipment"
   6. Confirm the blockchain transaction in MetaMask
   7. Wait for transaction confirmation
   8. Your shipment is now created with a unique ID!

Q: What happens after I create a shipment?
A: When you create a shipment:
   1. A unique Shipment ID is generated
   2. The shipment is recorded on the blockchain
   3. A QR code is generated for tracking
   4. The assigned transporter is notified
   5. Status is set to "CREATED"
   6. You can track it from your dashboard

Q: How much does it cost to create a shipment?
A: Creating a shipment requires a small gas fee (paid in ETH) for the 
   blockchain transaction. On our testnet (Ganache), this is free test ETH.
   On mainnet, costs vary based on network congestion.

A: Yes! If you have a QR code image:
   1. Click "Upload QR" instead of "Scan"

   1. Make sure you've allowed camera permissions
   2. Ensure good lighting on the QR code
   3. Hold the camera steady, about 6-12 inches away
   4. Make sure the entire QR code is visible in frame
   5. Try the "Upload Image" option as an alternative
   6. Check if another app is using the camera
   7. Refresh the page and try again

SECTION 7: BLOCKCHAIN & SECURITY

A: Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that:
   - Records transactions permanently and transparently

   Sentinel uses blockchain to create tamper-proof supply chain records.

   - Blockchain immutability (records cannot be changed)
   - Cryptographic authentication (no passwords to hack)
   - Role-based access control
   - Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS)
   - No central point of failure

Q: What network does Sentinel run on?
A: Sentinel can run on:
   - Local Ganache (for development/testing)
   - Ethereum Testnets (Sepolia, Goerli)
   - Ethereum Mainnet (for production)
   Check with your administrator for the current network.
