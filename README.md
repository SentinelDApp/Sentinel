🔐 Sentinel
Blockchain-Based Real-Time Supply Chain Tracker

Sentinel is a blockchain-powered supply chain monitoring system that brings transparency, traceability, and accountability to logistics operations. It acts as a digital watchguard, ensuring every shipment movement is recorded immutably and can be verified at any point in the supply chain.

🚀 Why Sentinel?

Traditional supply chains rely on manual updates, centralized databases, and trust-based reporting — making them vulnerable to errors, delays, and fraud.

Sentinel solves this by:

Recording shipment updates on a decentralized blockchain

Making records tamper-proof and auditable

Linking every update to a verified wallet identity

Providing real-time visibility to all stakeholders

✨ Key Features

🔗 Blockchain-backed tracking – Immutable shipment records

🧠 Smart Contracts – Automated and trusted updates

👤 Role-Based Access – Supplier, Warehouse, Transporter, Customer

🔐 Wallet Authentication – Every update is traceable to a user

📦 QR-Based Shipment Identification

📊 Live Dashboard for monitoring shipment status

⚙️ Optional IoT / NFC Integration for physical verification

🧩 How It Works

A shipment is created and registered on the blockchain

A unique QR code is generated for the shipment

At each checkpoint (warehouse / transit), the QR is scanned

Smart contracts log the update immutably

Stakeholders track real-time status via the dashboard

🏭 Use Cases

💊 Pharmaceutical cold-chain logistics

🌾 Agricultural product traceability

📱 High-value goods & electronics

🚚 General logistics & e-commerce

🔒 Security & Trust Model

Blockchain ensures data cannot be altered

Every update is signed by a wallet

Unauthorized users cannot modify shipment data

Fraud attempts become traceable and accountable

⚠️ Note: Blockchain ensures data integrity, not physical truth. Sentinel mitigates this using accountability, digital signatures, and optional hardware-based verification.

📈 Future Scope

🤖 AI-based fraud & delay prediction

🌐 Cross-chain interoperability

📡 Full IoT sensor automation

📱 Mobile application support

🧠 Project Vision

Sentinel doesn’t just track shipments — it guards trust in the supply chain.
